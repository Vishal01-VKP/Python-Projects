2Hello Everyone !

I'm Vishal Kumar Paswan , an aspiring Python coder who is currently 17 years old . 

Since I'm basically a high-schooler , all I've done is some basic training on Python - and GUI making . 

I've made some GUIs in the form of .zip files in the 'Apps' section . Everyone can use that - and if possible , recommend me changes .

My current GUI projects will be in the 'GUIs' section .

I've also started to learn Kivy and make some basic GUIs , but if anyone knows about a well known area where one can learn more about Kivy , please recommend that here as well .

Other files are also here , and if someone wants to know more , comment here or at www.vkpythonprojects.blogspot.com .
